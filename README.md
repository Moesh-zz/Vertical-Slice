# Vertical Slice
Vertical slice is the project codename for a competitive Minecraft multiplayer game. It is designed for teams of three players.

_Builders_ use clever scaffolding tricks to ascend a tower quickly to capture the enemy's banner. _Breakers_ use a trident enchanted with Riptide to fly through the air and tear down scaffolding. First to three captures win.

## Installation
_Designed for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.14+_

Download the repo and drop in your saves folder. The map will be initalized when the world is opened.

## Roadmap
This is hastily written and loosely set-up.

**Prototype** âœ”
A prototype was created during this [seven hour livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433409952). While a bit rough, it showed a lot of promise.

We determined scaffolding absolutely must be paired with unique co-op building opportunities which allow the players to ascend quickly while creating reusable paths.

We determined _Breakers_ must have some more unique travel challenges, such as limiting where rain is allowed to fall and discouraging landing or walking on ground entirely.

We determined three player teams suited the ultimate goal and objective. To cleverly ascend quickly, while safeguarding your scaffolding route, and capture the banner from your enemy's tower to return to your base.

Additional prototyping is done to test co-op situations with scaffolding. Environmental challenges are theorized, made, and judged.

**First playable** (in-progress)
Core game mechanics are cleaned up and made complete. All main elements of the game are in place. Match handling is still a manual process, but the game is replayable.

Look and feel are developed. First level is whiteboxed. Placeholder assets are used.

**Vertical slice**
All core features of the game are present, with a little taste of everything. While it may not be the final presentation, the full feel of the game is present. Players can play full matches and experiment with the range of the tools we've given them to play with.

The first level is further refined to be the total showcase of what the game design has to offer.

**Final build**
Additional levels are designed with a core set of assets. Tutorial and onboarding development begins. Additional levels are designed, probably a total of three.

**Release**
Media assets are readied. Video trailer developed. Tournament stream will be planned.
